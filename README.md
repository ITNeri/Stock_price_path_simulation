# Stock_price_path_simulation
Mutiple stock price paths simulation by using Monte Carlo simulation

parameter:
100, 0.08, 0.03, 0.2, 100, 1000, 1000
s0, t, r, sig, m, n, z
s0 = initial stock price = 100
t = time to maturity = 20/250 = 0.08
r = risk-less short rate = 0.03
sig = volatility of stock value = 0,2
m = the number of path nodes = 100
n = the number of simulations = 1000
z = the number of lines showed in the graph = 1000
